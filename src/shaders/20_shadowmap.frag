/*
20_shadowmap.frag: fragment shader for the creation of the shadow map

It does nothing: the shadow rendering step writes in a dedicated FBO the depth information of each fragment from the point of view of the light, and it does not calculate the color information

N.B. 1)  "19_shadowmap.vert" must be used as vertex shader
